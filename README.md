  * Paste the token in **Authorize** from Swagger followed by "Bearer". Example: "Bearer {token}"

# Notes
  * Has Swagger incorporated
  * The service will log into "C:\Logs\AppLogs.log"
  * It could be more specific with the errors it returns and have better data validation, but I ran out of time. üëç
